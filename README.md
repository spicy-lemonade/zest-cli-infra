Zest CLI translates natural language into shell commands using locally-trained small language models. macOS only. Learn more at [zestcli.com](https://zestcli.com).

### Why Zest CLI?

- **Small language models** — purpose-trained SLMs optimised for CLI command translation
- **Runs offline** — runs entirely on your machine with no network calls at inference time
- **Runs on CPU** — no GPU needed, works on any modern Mac
- **No cloud** — no cloud dependencies at inference time
- **No API keys** — no accounts, tokens, or subscriptions required
- **Privacy first** — your commands and queries never leave your device
- **No tracking** — zero telemetry or usage collection
- **No logging** — nothing is recorded or stored beyond your local session
- **No analytics** — your usage patterns are never observed or analysed

## 🏗 Architecture & Data Flow

While the core agent runs **offline on CPU** (privacy-first, no tracking), the training pipeline utilizes Google Cloud Storage (GCS) to manage datasets before they are loaded into Google Colab for fine-tuning.

We utilize a **Medallion Architecture** pattern for data storage to ensure reproducibility and data quality:

| Layer | Bucket Role |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🥉 Base** | Raw input data (e.g., scraped CLI help docs, raw command logs). |
| **🥈 Staging** | Cleaned and deduplicated data (per dataset deduplication); intermediate processing. |
| **🥇 Mart** | Final training-ready datasets with cross-dataset deduplication. |
| **🪣 Models** | Storage for final models. |

All training data buckets have versioning enabled (keeping 1 previous version). See [docs/model_releases.md](docs/model_releases.md) for details on model storage and release operations.
