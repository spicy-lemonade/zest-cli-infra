# 🌶️ Zest CLI from Spicy Lemonade 🍋

#### Small language models. Runs offline. Runs on CPU. No cloud. No API keys. Privacy first. No tracking.

Zest CLI translates natural language into shell commands using a local small language model. MacOS only. Learn more at [zestcli.com](https://zestcli.com).

## 🚀 Beyond the Basics
While the GIF shows simple file management, Zest is designed for a variety of domains:

- Networking: "Show all active listening TCP ports"
- Docker: "Show the logs for the Docker container `my-app`"
- Git: "Show the most recent commit that modified the file `components/pages/AboutPage.tsx`"
- System: "Check my disk usage sorted by the top 5 largest directories in my home folder"

*Note: Zest works best with single requests. i.e. `show the top 5 XXX` is better than `show the top 5 XXX or YYY`*

### Why Zest CLI?

- **Small language models** — purpose-trained SLMs optimised for CLI command translation
- **Runs offline** — runs entirely on your machine with no network calls at inference time
- **Runs on CPU** — no GPU needed, works on any modern Mac
- **No cloud** — no cloud dependencies at inference time
- **No API keys** — no accounts, tokens, or subscriptions required
- **Privacy first** — your commands and queries never leave your device
- **No tracking** — zero telemetry, user data, or usage data collection

## 🏗 Model Architecture

While the core agent runs **offline on CPU** (privacy-first, no tracking), the training pipeline utilizes Google Cloud Storage (GCS) to manage datasets before they are loaded into Google Colab for fine-tuning.
